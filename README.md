This project is an etch-a-sketch of sorts. Basically I am aiming to make a grid of varying size depending on user input and add properties to the cells. 

Review: Generally this was good CSS & Javascript practice, but the interesting part was creating a grid using Flexbox. 
Using flex to dynimically set the box sizes being created in JS was key.
