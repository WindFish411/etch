    <!--The grid is set in a box. It is essentially fixed in place. Should be able to change the amount of squares without the size of the box changing.-->
    <!--I imagine that JS will be used to create the grid, not sure about the HTML really. Apparently flexbox is the main challenge here?-->
    <!--Flexbox? I guess the padding, margin, and border values can really mess with how it looks? Start by just getting a grid down using JS.-->
    <!--Maybe creating 16 divs of class square can be used? selectByClass('square')-->
